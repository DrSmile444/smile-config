## Goal and Philosophy

Well configured projects allow a team to work effectively and fast.
Some organizations have their configs and reuse them on different projects.
Suddenly, the setup of each tool requires time, and often this step is skipped, which leads to worse and magic code.

`Smile-Config` allows you to save this config and files to a sharable module.
You can apply this module to any project in few steps.
`Smile-Config` will install all needed dependencies and copy files, so you don't need to waste time configuring your tools each time.

It features Node.js best practices techniques in the default config, so you can start using it immediately.

Additionally, you can manually select which modules you want to use in your project, so it's flexible.
Each module can include different configs, such as for frontend, backend, frameworks, and others.
Thus, you can build a pure and complex module as well.

## Quickstart

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install the package globally:

```shell script
$ npm install smile-config -g
```

Or use it immediately:

 ```shell script
$ npx smile-config
```

That's it! Now you can use the app in any folder.

## Custom select

Built-in and your configs support custom module selecting, so you can choose your setup.
